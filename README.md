#Credit Card Default Classification
This project analyzes and predicts whether a credit card client is likely to default on their payment next month based on various demographic and financial attributes.

📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Attributes: Demographic data (e.g., age, education, marriage), payment history, bill statement, and default status.

🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate a machine learning model that classifies clients into defaulters and non-defaulters.

🧪 Methods
Logistic Regression for baseline modeling

StandardScaler for feature scaling

Classification metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Visualizations: Confusion matrix, ROC curve
